# state-app
Simple Flask web application

This project is a simple Flask web application that allows users to log in, view a list of states in the United States, and select a state to highlight it in the list. The application uses HTML templates for rendering pages and a CSV file (states.csv) to store the state data. It also includes a basic login system with hardcoded credentials.
I am just keeping these notes for myself when I return to make changes.

# Features:

Home page with a login form
- Ability to log in with hardcoded credentials
- Display of a list of states with the option to highlight a selected state
- Simple routing using Flask
- Use of templates for rendering HTML pages

# Planned Improvements:

- Add user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- Implement a more secure way to handle user login credentials, such as using a database to store and retrieve user information.
- Enhance the user interface with CSS and JavaScript to make it more interactive and visually appealing.
- Add error handling and validation for user inputs.
- Document the project with a README file explaining how to set up and run the application.
- Include comments and documentation in the code to make it more understandable for other developers.
